# Staffing App V3

## Why
After a year of professional experience I have decided to rebuild the staffing app I have built twice before.
This time I will be using the Flask framework rather than Django. I'm rebuilding the same APP as I love to see how far I have come

#### What I want to achieve;

I want to learn Flask

To better understand the code I have been developing for the past year and by writing it in Flask by reimplementing it myself for my own project

Improve my testing ability

### Resources
The app I will be building will be using the below resources as a guide as I improve my skills;

https://testdriven.io/courses/tdd-flask/

https://github.com/cosmicpython/book

There will be many more but these will form the backbone of what I am building
